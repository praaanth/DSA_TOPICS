/*
 given intervels return max profit we can get without overlapping 
   these are also similar kanpsack kind of problems 
   if not pick go to next index
  if pick go to next intervel whose start time is greater than the end time 
  the next intervel can be find using binary search 
  leetcode 
  2054->> two best non-overlapping intervels
  646--> max length of pair chain
  2008--> maximum earnings from taxi
  1751--> maximum number of events that can attended 2

  lintcode
  300--> meetings rooms 4


  max length of pair chains 

  using dp we can easily do using binary search concept for finding the next index


  using greedy with what time we need to sort 
    if we sort based on the start time happens 
    [[7,9],[4,5],[7,9],[-7,-1],[0,10],[3,10],[3,6],[2,3]]
    sort the above example in start time
    [-7,-1],[0,10],[2,3],[3,6],[3,10],[4,5],[7,9],[7,9]

  we are storing the end time and length of non -overlapping intervals

    pq--> [[-1,1]]
    now [0,10]
     pop -1
    pq--> [10,2]
    now to pop this 10 interval we need to have the interval x>10
     if we ignore this interval 
     [-7,-1] can be chained with [2,3] and so on this is  why this sorting on start time fails

     ----------->
     so we sort based on the end time to get the maximum number of intervals
