/*
Minimum cost for Tickets
Intution is similar to coin change problem but here the sum is not constant
we have 3 options we can choose min of these 3 is the answer
if we pick day_1 
   d_1=c[0]+f(ind+1,d,c);
     //  pick the week ticket
       int i=ind;
        for(; i<n; i++) {
             if(d[i]>=d[ind]+7) break; /// here wh it is equal condn because [1,7,8] we are at index 0 
             // 1+7 ==8 from 8 onwards we need to calculate the answer
        }
       d_7= c[1]+f(i,d,c);
